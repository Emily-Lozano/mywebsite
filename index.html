        <p>
            Here is the drafted KrayonCad that I contributed on for the FRC robotics team at my school for 2025. 
            The game for the competition this year was recently released and my team held a two day kickofff in which
            we discussed game strategies and robot designs. After a long discussion we made this very preminalary first design 
            using KrayonCad on onshape. The design we hope to achieve for this year consists of four major components. 
            These components are a three staged cascade elevator, a reorienting mechanism for the cylinder allowing it 
            to be reoriented to the vertical axis, a cylinder (coral) specific intake, and a ball (algae) specific intake which consists of a roller.

        <h2>FRC Design Gearbox</h2>
        <img src = "FRC Design Gearbox.png" alt = "FRC Gearbox" width = "900" height = "500" >

        <p>
            For this project I decided to try cadding a gearbox from scratch 
            without given a previously made sketch or looking at tutorials. 
            This project has tested my knowledge on gears and just how to 
            make a system that makes sure that all the gears will mesh properly 
            in the end product. I hope to finish this project in the near 
            future.

        <h2>FRC Drivetrain</h2>
        <img src = "Drivetrain.png" alt = "Drivetrain" width = "900" height = "500" >
        <p>
            Upon joining the robotics team one of the first exercises 
            I did in order to further my knowledge in cad. This project 
            allowed me to experiment with linear patterns and let me learn 
            how to use sketches to help me cad. This project also allowed me 
            to experiment with the beginner mates such as the fastened and revolute 
            mates. With this project I was able to take my knowledge from extruding 
            simple square sketches to being able to implement my knowledge onto FRC 
            mechanisms.

        <h2>CAD Assembly and Simulation</h2>

        </video>
        <p>
            The video showcased above is another cadding exercise that I completed in 
            which I learned more about assemblies and assembly systems. This project
            allowed me to put together different parts and correctly simulate their 
            movement by adding mates in specific locations. Even though this project is 
            introductory level I hold this project close because it allowed me to correctly learn how 
            to use mates on Onshape and develop the mindset of working through cad practice.

        <h2>CAD Optimization: Defining and FeatureScripts</h2>
        <img src = "Frame.png" alt = "Frame" width = "400" height = "400" >
        <img src = "Climber Hook.png" alt = "Hook" width = "400" height = "400" >
        <img src = "Gearbox.png" alt = "Gearbox" width = "800" height = "400" >
        <p>
            These projects allowed me to learn how to optimize the 
            features available on Onshape to cut the amount of time 
            it takes to cad by almost half. From a box tubing featurescript 
            that allows me to automatically structure box tubing to a featurescript 
            that creates gussets by selecting the targeted holes, I am able to complete 
            projects much faster allowing me to explore and go into depth 
            with even more projects. The climber hook project in specific 
            allowed me to explore the different ways to fully define 
            sketches on parts studios and put me a step forward into 
            learning how to make parametric cad.

        <h2>CAD Full Robot Assembly</h2>

        <img src = "Full Robot Assembly.png" alt = "Drivetrain" width = "400" height = "400" >
        <p>
            This full robot assembly allowed me to learn about 
            the significance of intergrating master sketches in the cadding process. 
            By adding master sketches you are able to plan out your project with added visuals
            and can use the derive feature that Onshape provides you to quickly build off of 
            the sketch. The master sketch also helps speed up the process because if a change is
            needed you can make the direct change on the master sketch and these changes will carry 
            on to all of the part studios in the assembly. This project also helped me learn the 
            importance of importing parts in Onshape.

            I took on a cadathon with a group in which we were given a mock FRC game and tasked with 
            designing and cadding a full robot in around 11 days. Once our group reached a consencus
            on a design I was tasked with figuring out how to cad one of the major components which 
            was the cascade elevator. Up to that point I had no experience on how to make an elevator 
            cad or just how to rig a cascade elevator. The first portion of this project was me 
            researching for the most effective way in making the base structure. After around a few 
            hours I was able to make a fully parametric base sketch. This method allowed me to extrude 
            all the major parts in one go and if I needed to make any changes in the dimensions it could 
            easily be handled. However, after this was when I had to tackle to issue of successfully rigging 
            an elevator. When rigging this elevator I had to take into account for the fact that our teams 
            design required an open carriage to leave space for an arm which made rigging a bit harder. 
            The majority of the process was me seeking out visual models of already rigged elevators which 
            allowed me to grasp the idea on what connections need to be made between the different stages.
