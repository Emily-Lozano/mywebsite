            Here is the drafted KrayonCad that I contributed on for the FRC robotics team at my school for 2025. 
            The game for the competition this year was recently released and my team held a two day kickofff in which
            we discussed game strategies and robot designs. After a long discussion we made this very preminalary first design 
            using KrayonCad on onshape. The design we hope to achieve for this year consists of four major components. 
            These components are a three staged cascade elevator, a reorienting mechanism for the cylinder allowing it 
            to be reoriented to the vertical axis, a cylinder (coral) specific intake, and a ball (algae) specific intake which consists of a roller.
